# üîß Payment Methods Display Fix Summary

## Issue Resolved
**Problem**: Active payment methods were disappearing after a few seconds, leaving only inactive ones visible.

## Root Cause
The JavaScript code for auto-hiding success/error alert messages was using a broad CSS selector that also targeted active payment method cards:

```javascript
// PROBLEMATIC CODE
const alerts = document.querySelectorAll('.bg-green-50, .bg-red-50');
```

This selector was matching:
- ‚úÖ **Alert messages** (intended target)
- ‚ùå **Active payment method cards** (unintended target - causing them to disappear)

## Solution Applied
Made the CSS selector more specific to only target actual alert messages by including the `.mb-6` class:

### Before (Problematic Code):
```javascript
const alerts = document.querySelectorAll('.bg-green-50, .bg-red-50');
```

### After (Fixed Code):
```javascript
const alerts = document.querySelectorAll('.mb-6.bg-green-50, .mb-6.bg-red-50');
```

## How the Fix Works

### Alert Messages Structure:
```html
<div class="mb-6 bg-green-50 border border-green-200 text-green-700 px-4 py-3 rounded-lg">
    <!-- Success/Error message content -->
</div>
```
- **Has both**: `.mb-6` AND `.bg-green-50` classes
- **Result**: ‚úÖ **Will be hidden** after 5 seconds

### Active Payment Method Cards Structure:
```html
<div class="border border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-4 bg-green-50 border-green-200">
    <!-- Payment method content -->
</div>
```
- **Has only**: `.bg-green-50` class (no `.mb-6`)
- **Result**: ‚úÖ **Will remain visible** permanently

## What Changed
1. **Specific Targeting**: Only elements with BOTH `.mb-6` AND `.bg-green-50`/`.bg-red-50` classes are hidden
2. **Preserved Functionality**: Alert messages still auto-hide after 5 seconds
3. **Fixed Display**: All payment methods (active and inactive) remain visible permanently
4. **Maintained Styling**: No visual changes to the interface

## Testing Results
‚úÖ **Alert Messages**: Auto-hide after 5 seconds as intended  
‚úÖ **Active Payment Methods**: Remain visible permanently  
‚úÖ **Inactive Payment Methods**: Remain visible permanently  
‚úÖ **Toggle Functionality**: Switching between active/inactive still works  
‚úÖ **Visual Indicators**: Green/gray backgrounds and badges still work correctly  

## Files Modified
- `admin/payment-settings.php` - Updated JavaScript selector on line 432

## Current Behavior
- **Success/Error Messages**: Appear for 5 seconds, then fade out and disappear
- **Active Payment Methods**: Green background, remain visible permanently
- **Inactive Payment Methods**: Gray background, remain visible permanently
- **All Payment Methods**: Can be toggled between active/inactive states

## Status
‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - All payment methods now display correctly without disappearing
