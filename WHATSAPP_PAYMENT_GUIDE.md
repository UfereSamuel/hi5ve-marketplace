# WhatsApp Payment System - Hi5ve MarketPlace

## Overview
The WhatsApp Payment System allows customers to initiate payments via WhatsApp and have admins manually confirm the payments once received. This is perfect for Nigerian markets where customers prefer to pay via bank transfers, mobile money, or cash deposits and send proof via WhatsApp.

## How It Works

### For Customers:
1. **Select WhatsApp Payment** during checkout
2. **Complete order** - system generates a payment reference
3. **Click WhatsApp link** - opens WhatsApp with pre-filled payment message
4. **Contact admin** via WhatsApp with payment details
5. **Send proof of payment** (screenshot, receipt, etc.)
6. **Wait for confirmation** - admin will confirm payment in the system

### For Admins:
1. **Receive WhatsApp message** from customer with payment request
2. **Provide payment details** (bank account, mobile money, etc.)
3. **Receive proof of payment** from customer
4. **Verify payment** in bank/mobile money account
5. **Confirm in admin panel** - go to Admin > Payments
6. **Update order status** - system automatically updates order to confirmed

## Admin Payment Management
